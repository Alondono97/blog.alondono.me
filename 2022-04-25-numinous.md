When I was 19 I hiked for three days through a portion of the Andes with my brother and my father. We ascended from the base of a valley into a forest that marked the edge of mountains. We ducked branches and waded rivers until, over time, the elevation shrunk trees into shrubbery and delivered us into clouds. Through much of our journey, a thick fog surrounded our group preventing us from seeing any further than a few meters in front of us. Eventually, however, after arduous hours on our feet, the clouds lifted onto the edge of a valley. The mountains cleared, palming a house isolated from the world, and blanketed by grass and small bushes. From our vantage, the house looked built for dolls. I reached out and picked it up, tossing it in the air with one hand, then catching it in the other. Over and over. Until I tossed it one too many times, and it flew too high, and on the way down it slipped through my fingers, tumbling back into the void of the valley. In a scramble to catch it, I followed it over the edge. Around the void the mountains loomed, shrinking the house below. Shrinking me in my free fall. Towering. Growing taller with each passing second. Each one a finger in the hand of the valley. Each one a face watching over its dominion, daring me to venture deeper. Giants as old as time carved by forces greater than man held me in their gaze without seeing me at all. I shrunk as I fell. I transformed into an ant, crawling over these tectonic colossi that could swat me away any moment they wanted, if ever they even noticed me. And through this metamorphosis I stepped into the valley with awe.

Aldous Huxley when meditating on the moon called it numinous.
