Climate change skeptics often cite data showing that the planet has undergone drastic changes in climate before. They argue that our current climate change is another natural occurrence and not caused by human activity. These arguments are commonly used to push back against decarbonization efforts such as carbon capture and renewable energy adoption. Yet, these arguments still acknowledge the existence of climate change. 

With that acknowledgement in mind, I argue that climate change being human caused or not does not matter. Carbon capture and renewable energy are still the only logical path forward for humanity.

The bases for my claim are the following two statements (supported by raw data)<sup id="cite_one">[[1](#foot_note_one)]</sup> :

1. The amount of CO<sub>2e</sub>  parts per million in the atmosphere has increased at an unprecedented rate since 1850, and continues to do so <sup id="cite_two">[[2](#foot_note_two)]</sup>

2. Average global surface temperature has increased as a direct result of (1)

If this trends continue, climate models predict it will spell disaster for humanity. 

## Carbon Capture

In the event that trends (1) and (2) are not caused by industrialization, carbon capture should still continue development. If climate scientists are incorrect on the source, we are left without a strong consensus on what has caused the CO<sub>2e</sub> increase. Nothing, so far, indicates that these trends will stop. As a result, it only makes sense to operate as if they won't and actively take steps to counteract them. 

Let's assume that fossil fuel consumption is not the cause of our increase in CO<sub>2e</sub> concentration.  We still need to find a way to decrease it. Given the initial assumption, decreasing fossil fuel use would not fix the CO<sub>2e</sub> increase problem. Since we don't know the cause of CO<sub>2e</sub> increase the only option remaining is active removal of carbon from our atmosphere. 

Enter carbon capture. 

<span id="paths"> If we take into account the possible ways the climate crisis plays out, two paths emerge. These two paths lead to four potential outcomes: </span>

Path 1: Climate science predictions are correct. Climate change will continue in its current direction and the consequences of it will be catastrophic.

Path 2: Climate science predictions are incorrect. The previously observed changes in climate will be uneventful.

Say we invest in carbon capture development. In the event that path 1 occurs, the development of large scale carbon capture can potentially save us from catastrophe. If we develop this technology and path 2 happens then we suffer no major consequences either way. Both of these scenarios are favorable outcomes for us.

In the event that we do not develop carbon capture technology and path 1 takes place then disaster unfolds. The climate continues on its current trajectory, and we suffer the consequences. If path 2 ensues, then we suffer no major consequences. However, in this scenario only 1/2 of the possible outcomes are in our favor. 

100% favorable results vs only 50% favorable are not odds worth gambling against.

If we believe that climate change is occurring due to atmospheric CO2 increase, development of carbon capture technology is the most logical path forward, regardless of its source. 

## Renewable Energy

Even if we continue to believe that fossil fuel use is not causing climate change, we should still continue development of renewable energy technology. Fossil fuels are a finite resource that will only diminish in supply as time goes on.  Societal dependence on them will culminate in mass conflict as our major energy resource disappears. A shift in global dependence from fossil fuels to renewable resources will avoid conflict and set humanity up for success in years to come. It will create a more abundant society not limited by energy scarcity. 

Additionally, the pollution caused by fossil fuel consumption has caused severe harm to humans who breathe it in. Cities with heavy industry produce smog, lowering air quality for its residents. Many people suffer from respiratory illness and millions die yearly, all as a direct result of fossil fuel combustion. A renewable energy society would not suffer from these issues since renewable sources produce no pollution when generating energy.<sup id="cite_three">[[3](#foot_note_three)]</sup> <sup id="cite_four">[[4](#foot_note_four)]</sup>

Consideration of the two possible paths that climate change can take results in similar conclusions for renewable energy as with Carbon Removal.<sup id="cite_five">[[5](#foot_note_five)]</sup> The probabilities of favorable vs unfavorable outcomes support the adoption of renewable resources. 

With all this in  mind, further development of carbon capture and renewable energy is in the best interest of humanity, independent of what is causing climate change. 

### Footnotes
[<a href="#cite_one" name="foot_note_one">1</a>] These are general footnotes, not necessarily sources, but the cited data is backed by historical climate science. If interested, the IPCC reports provide comprehensive information on climate science measurements, models, and predictions. The [AR6 Summary For Policy Makers](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#SPM) presents an accessible overview of the latest data. Also, when I say "raw data supported" I mean that the data does not need much analysis, you can take it at face value and still see these trends.

[<a href="#cite_two" name="foot_note_two">2</a>] CO<sub>2e</sub> is a metric used to compare different greenhouse gas impact on global warming to CO<sub>2</sub>. This used as a standard unit of emission measurement. Essentially saying, for example, X amount of Methane will cause the _equivalent_ amount of global warming as Y amount of CO<sub>2</sub>. Ex: 1 kg methane -> 25 kg CO<sub>2</sub> -> 25 kg CO<sub>2e</sub>

[<a href="#cite_three" name="foot_note_three">3</a>] [Our World In Data has an article giving an overview of deaths due to air pollution.](https://ourworldindata.org/data-review-air-pollution-deaths)

[<a href="#cite_four" name="foot_note_four">4</a>] Caveat nuclear energy and nuclear waste. However, nuclear waste is minor, comparatively. 

[<a href="#cite_five" name="foot_note_five">5</a>] We'll repeat the analysis here so as to not pollute the main body of the post.

 <a href="#paths">The two potential paths, explained earlier in this post:</a> 

(Summarized)<br>
Path 1: climate change continues

Path 2: climate change does not continue

These lead once again to four potential outcomes:

We invest in renewable energy and Path 1 occurs. Renewables as our main energy resource save us from catastrophe. If path 2 takes place then we suffer no major consequences with regards to climate, and the world is no longer dependent on scarce energy resources. Both of these scenarios are favorable for us.

In the event that we do not continue renewable energy development, and path 1 happens, then we will experience disaster. The climate continues on its current trajectory, and we suffer the consequences. If path 2 unfolds then we undergo no major climate consequences, but the world continues to deplete a scarce energy resource. Again, in this scenario only 1/2 of the possible outcomes are even vaguely in our favor.
