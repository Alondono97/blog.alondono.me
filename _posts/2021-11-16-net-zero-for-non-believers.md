Climate change skeptics often cite data showing that the planet has undergone drastic changes in climate before. They argue that our current climate change is another natural occurence and not caused by human activity. These arguments still acknowledge the existence of climate change. 

I argue that the cause of climate change does not matter. Carbon capture and renewable energy are still the only logical path forward for humanity.

Pure data exists to back the following two statements:

1. The amount of CO<sub>2e</sub> ppm in the atmosphere has  increased at an alarming rate since 1850 and continues to do so.

2. Average global surface temperature has increased as a direct result of (1).

If this trends continue, climate models predict this will spell disaster for humanity. 

## Carbon Capture

If climate scientists are incorrect and trends (1) and (2) are not caused by industrialization, then we have no way of knowing if they will continue or not [1]. There is nothing to indicate that these trends will stop. So it only makes sense to operate as if they won't, and actively take steps to counteract them. 

Let's assume that fossil fuel consumption is not the cause of our increase in CO<sub>2e</sub> concentration.  We still need to find a way to decrease it. Given our initial assumption, decreasing fossil fuel use would not fix the CO<sub>2e</sub> increase problem. Since we don't know the cause of CO2 increase the only option remaining is active removal of carbon from our atmosphere. 

Enter carbon capture. 

If we take into account the possible ways the climate crisis plays out  two paths emerge with four potential outcomes:

Path 1: Climate science predictions are correct. Climate change will continue in its current direction and the consequences of it will be catastrophic.

Path 2: Climate science predictions are incorrect. The previously observed changes in climate will be uneventful.

Say we invest in carbon capture development. In the event that path 1 occurs, the development of large scale carbon capture can  potentially save us from catastrophe. If we develop this technology and path 2 happens to occur then we suffer no major consequences either way. Both of these scenarios are favorable outcomes for us.

In the event that we do not develop carbon capture technology and path 1 occurs then disaster occurs. The climate continues on its current trajectory, and we suffer the consequences. If path 2 occurs then no major consequences occur. However, in this scenario only 1/2 of the possible outcomes are in our favor. 

100% favorable results vs only 50% favorable are not odds worth gambling against.

If you believe that climate change is occurring, regardless of cause, development of carbon capture technology is the only path forward. 

## Renewable Energy

Even if we continue to believe that fossil fuel use is not causing climate change, we should still continue to pursue the development of renewable energy technology. Fossil fuels are a finite resource that will only diminish in supply as time goes on.  Societal dependence on them will culminate in mass conflict as our major energy resource disappears. A shift in global dependence from fossil fuels to renewable resources will avoid conflict and set humanity up for success in years to come. It will create a more abundant society not limited by scarce resources.

Considering the two possible paths (as above) that climate change can take similar  ends in similar conclusions. The probabilities of favorable vs unfavorable outcomes support the adoption of renewable resources. 

Further development of carbon capture and renewable energy is in the best interest of humanity, independent of what is causing climate change.
