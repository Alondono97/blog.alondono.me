Regardless of whether or not the cause is human activity, anyone that believes the planet's climate is undergoing drastic change should support the current initiative to shift to a carbon neutral society via carbon capture technology and renewable energy resource adoption. 

If we assume that believing in a drastically changing climate means objectively accepting the following two data points of current climate science:

1. The amount of CO<sub>2e</sub> ppm in the atmosphere has steadily increased at an alarming rate since 1850 and continues to do so

2. Average global surface temperature has increased as a direct result of (1)

then we can conclude that this has led the climate to undergo drastic changes[1], and will continue to do so, to the detriment of human civilization. 

In the event that fossil fuel consumption is not the direct cause of an increase in CO<sub>2e</sub> atmospheric concentration, the fact of the matter remains that we need to find a way to decrease that concentration. Continuing that line of reasoning, decreasing our use of fossil fuels for energy and industrial production should not make any significant dent in our CO<sub>2e</sub> ppm increase problems[2]. The only remaining option, then, for decreasing our atmospheric CO<sub>2e</sub> ppm and preventing the disasters predicted, would be to invest in technology that directly removes carbon from our atmosphere. 

Therefore, if you believe that climate change is occuring, regardless of cause, you should find a way to support and encourage the development and use of carbon capture technology. 

Furthermore, even if we believe that fossil fuel use is not harming the environment, we should still continue to pursue the development of renewable energy technology[3]. Fossil fuels are a finite resource that will only diminish in supply as time goes on. Our societal dependence on them will inevitavely lead to massive conflict as our major energy resource disappears. A shift in global dependence from fossil fuels to renewable resources will no longer avoid this conflict but set humanity up for success in years to come to produce a more abundant and equitable society not limited by scarce resources. 

With these two arguments in mind, it is only logical to conclude that carbon capture and renewable energy technology is in the best interest of human societal development moving into the future, regardless of the current state or cause of climate change. 

[1] Increased temperature leads to melting ice caps which leads to increased sea levels. Increased temperature leads to increased precipitation in tropical regions. Increased temprature leads to increased forest fires and droughts in already naturally dry regions. (These are all oversimplifications of course, but the conclusions still follow and hold when you get into the details of the climate science).

[2] I want to emphasize that I'm simply following a line of reasoning here from a previously assumed basis. My personal belief, based on climate data and scientific consenus, is that climate change is largely caused by human activity, industrialization, and fossil fuel use. 

[3] Climate science data overwhelmingly indicates that human fossil fuel use is in fact the primary driver of climate change and points (1) and (2) presented in the above body.
