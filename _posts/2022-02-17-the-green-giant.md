“There is only one fault, only one: our inability to feed upon light.” -Simone Weil

***

The men gathered to shake each other's hands. One opened a bottle of champagne. Biologists congratulated Botanists. Physicians congratulated Chemists. In a separate room visible through a glass pane in the wall, a middle aged man lay on an examination table.

“How are you feeling Bruce? Any headaches? Nausea?” One of the physicians asked through an intercom.

“No. I feel just as I did before.”

“We tried to keep the dosage light. We’ll have you under observation for 20 more minutes then you’re free to go.”

In an enclosure down the hallway a chimpanzee drank from a bottle. His skin and fur had begun to turn a light shade of green.

***

Two weeks passed. 

“How have you been feeling Bruce?” the physician asked. “Anything of concern?” 

He moved a light from side to side in front of his patient’s eyes. Bruce’s pupils blossomed and followed the bulb.

“Not at all. I feel great. Better, even.” Bruce said. “I haven’t eaten in ten days. But, I have a lot more energy. Been drinking much more water.”

“Getting plenty of sunshine, I hope?”

“Yes. That’s the only time I start to tire out really, when I can’t spend time in the sun.”

“Make sure you get outside as much as you can.”

Linda noticed it first, Bruce’s wife. She thought he’d contracted jaundice. Yellow skin was a common symptom. It started out subtle, but worsened within a few weeks. 

“Please, just make an appointment with Dr. Philmore. Have him examine you.”

“I feel fine. My next check-up isn’t for another month. They said there might be side effects.”

“What if it’s something else? You’re liver maybe. You know how you used to drink.”

“Please, not this again. I haven’t had one in years, and ever since the treatment, I haven’t wanted to. This is the best I’ve felt since my twenties. I don’t want to bother John.”

This exchange occurred daily. Until one day the yellow turned to green, and Bruce relented. He moved his check-up ahead a week.

“You seem fine to me.”

“I’m green, John.”

“Yes… we did notice that in the tests. It happened with some of the chimpanzees. But we thought we’d worked those kinks out.”

“How many of the chimps?”

“Er… all of them, but one. It’s because of the chloroplast. Nothing to worry about. Trust me. We’ll get on it immediately, and you’ll be back to your old color before you know it.”

“I trust you.”

“Is there anything else you’re concerned about?”

“No. I was telling Linda, I feel amazing. Been drinking a lot of water.”

“You’ve gotten taller.”

“You think so?”

“Yes. How tall do you think you are?”

“Six foot, last I checked.”

Linda pressed Bruce until his back was against the wall. She held the end of a measuring tape in her fingers and let the rest unwrap onto the floor. Standing on the tips of her toes, she set the end of the tape onto the wall next to the crown of Bruce’s head. Her foot kept the bottom of the measure taught. A few glances up and down to check the alignment, then she bent down to read the measurement.

“You’re six foot two now.”

“They said there’d be side effects.”

Bruce had been in and out of sleep all night. His skin itched. He could not stop scratching his chest and arms. Then his legs. Then his back. With a jolt, he ran to the bathroom. The lights blinded him and it took a minute for his eyes to re-adjust. When he could see again he looked in the mirror. 

His skin was green, but that was normal now. There was more noise to it this morning though. He looked down at his arms and saw mossy stubble. When he ran his hand over it, it felt cool and moist to the touch, like an early morning lawn catching its first droplets of dew. It didn’t stop there. It covered his whole body. 

On his chest the beginning of a budding leaf stemmed from below his skin. 

He left the bathroom, light still on, and walked out his back door. Linda, now coming to, watched him depart. She followed him.

“Honey? What’s going on?”

Bruce didn’t answer. He stepped out of his slippers and started pushing his toes into the dirt. When this proved ineffective, he bent over and shoveled earth with his hands until he’d covered his feet. He dug his fingers into the same soil and let out a sigh of relief. 

“Could you get me a glass of water?” he asked Linda.

Dr. John Phillmore didn’t usually make house calls, but today was an exception. It wasn’t just the fact that it was urgent. He felt guilty. Six months ago he’d suggested to one of his patients that they volunteer for an experimental procedure. The process, if successful, could very possibly solve world hunger. It was based on plant photosynthesis, and made non-plant organisms capable of converting sunlight directly into energy. But now the side effects were getting out of hand in the human trial in ways that none of the chimpanzee test subjects exhibited. 

Dr. Philmore parked his car in front of the house and walked up the driveway to the backyard. He’d barely made it halfway when Linda stormed around the corner.

“There you are you son of a bitch.”

“What’s happened? You said on the phone it was urgent.”

“Urgent? Urgent was a month ago when my husband started shoving his hands and feet into the ground! At least then he would come back inside after an hour.”

“We told you there might be side effects, we’re working around the clock to sort all this ou-”

“Side effects? Oh you- If you weren’t the only person on this fucking planet that could fix this I would personally run you out of town. Side effects was a fine excuse back when he turned green. What is happening now is beyond side effects.”

“What has happened?”

Linda sighed. “Just come to the back. You’ll see.”

Dr. Philmore followed Linda to her backyard. What he saw explained her anger. A tower more than seven feet tall consisting of leaves, vines, and moss stood in the yard. Closer inspection revealed the form of a man.The plants rose and fell in respiration. The doctor could just discern facial features from deep in the shrubbery. 

“Oh my. Bruce…?”

Leaves unfurled revealing Bruce’s visage. Chlorophyll eyes creaked open, half sunken, when the sunlight hit his face. 

“Hey John… thanks… for coming by… beautiful day… isn’t it?”

“I… What are you feeling? Are you in pain?”

“No… thanks… for asking… I feel… so peaceful…” 

He closed his eyes and raised his face to the sun.

Dr. Philmore turned to Linda. “When did this happen? How long has he been like this?”

Sorrow in her face aged her. She looked out into space, damming tears.
