At a high level in human mythology we seem to create two types of heroes to embody the values we want to carry as a society: The Ideal Hero and The Flawed Hero.

The Ideal Hero is easily recognized. It most commonly appears in religion and mythology. This hero at their prime or peak lacks flaws of any kind. They symbolize the values that their story seeks to convey to an impossible degree. The quintessential example of the ideal hero is Jesus Christ, the all powerful and perfect God taken the form of man to impart His values upon a flawed people. Superman could be argued to be another, although to a lesser degree seeing as how even Superman has his kryptonite.

The Flawed Hero is far more nuanced. They appear in mythology and religion, but the most common example comes from history. The flawed hero, at their core, is as human as can be, even when imbued with supernatural ability. As the name indicates, this type of heroes comes with flaws. The most important and effective flaws are their character flaws. All historical heroes are flawed because they are human. But the are heroes because they still exhibit qualities we strive for. The founding fathers of the United States had certain qualities worth revering like their value for civil freedoms (suffrage, speech, religion, assembly, etc.). Yet, many (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, among others) owned slaves. Heroic qualities, with flawed realities. 

The "Ideal" might change based on cultural values and what might be considered the pinnacle of those values, but the function of the ideal hero stays the same. Much like "Utopia" with regards to civilization, the ideal hero serves to provide a target to aim for when crafting one's character. This target is likely unachievable, but gives a direction in which to aim and improve towards. 
These heroes are often times the center pillar of religion because they are effective avenues for imparting those religious values to their followers. 

The historical iteration of the flawed hero falls into the pit trap of verifiable actions. The great acts of character that elevate them to heroic status in the collective consciousness of a society or culture are embedded into the historical record. However, these heroes are human and imperfect (hence the "flawed hero"). Their imperfect acts, which often betray their supposed character, will inevatibly surface on the historical record or be retroactively deemed ethically wrong.
