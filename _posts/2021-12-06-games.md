> We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.
-Winston Churchill

Yesterday I attended my brothers soccer game. During the game, I watched a player push down another from the opposite team and take the ball away from him. This action should have garnered the player a penalty, had the referee been paying more attention. But he wasn't, and it didnt. So the ball changed possession and the game continued on.

Pushing an opposing player over is against the rules. But __is the purpose of a game to win by following the rules? Or is breaking the rules in order to win part of the game?__

Our answer to this question shapes the games we play, how we play them, and the players themselves. I believe we want games where the players are just and behave fairly.

In the Japanese T.V. show, Naruto, the characters live in a warring world. In an early plot arc, the characters take a series of examinations to advance in their ranks. The first of these exams is a written test full of unreasonably difficult questions. The participants are not expected to know the correct answers to these questions. The only way they can pass would be to cheat off their neighbor, but if they are caught they will be disqualified. It is later revealed, they were _expected_ to cheat off each other. They were being evaluated on their ability to do so without being caught. Breaking the rules in order to win was part of the game because in their world, breaking rules is a means to an end: winning wars. Through out Naruto we see characters commit immoral acts to advance their own agenda. Sometimes the intent is to do good, but the means to do so is wrong. 

Do the ends justify the means? We have grappled with this question as far back as 375 B.C. when Plato wrote his famous dialogue, The Republic. In it he takes the opposite stance. In the context of justice and injustice, he believed that justice was an end in itself, not just a means.

One of the early debates in the text takes place between two characters, Glaucon and Socrates. Glaucon argues that it is better to _appear_ just, but in reality act unjustly. Behaving unjustly can advance someone's personal goals. As long as they are not caught behaving that way, they will not be punished. Socrates, conversely, defends the side of justice. He states that it is always better to behave justly, even when we reap no benefit from it. 

In his defence of justice, he describes a Just City. This city embodies his ideal qualities for a civilization: Wisdom, Courage, Discipline, and, of course, Justice. He argues that for the city to hold these qualities, its citizens must as well. But for the citizens to be "just", the city itself must be too. The results become circular. By being "just", the city makes its residents "just", and in turn, the citizens do the same for the city.

The stories in Naruto, in their own way, reach a similar conclusion. Citizens taught deceit and unfairness as virtues construct a society that reflects those values. The continuous warring state and cyclical violence in that world results from the behavior of its participants. And the participant's behavior is a reaction to an unjust world. 

Churchill said that first we shape our buildings, then they shape us. In that same way, we decide how we play our games, and they then decide the kind of players that participate. If we decide that part of our game is to break the rules then our game will create and attract players that value rule breaking. A society that idealizes injustice will create unjust citizens. To prevent this, we must shape our games, our societies, to be fair and to be just. In that way our players and our citizens will be just as well.
