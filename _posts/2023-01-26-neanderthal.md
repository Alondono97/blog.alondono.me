Arnold Sargot had a secret. 
When he was a young and intemperate man Arnold Sargot enlisted in his home country’s army. In doing so he interrupted his doctoral thesis in high energy physics. He’d spent three and a half years working away at it in hopes of achieving the honorable title of Doctor (Not of medicine, of course, as his mother was loath to remind him. Although, she never corrected others' assumption when the subject of his studies came up at dinner parties). 
Nonetheless, international tensions had accelerated in the previous decade and the world had fallen to war. So with unusual foresight of what was to come, Arnold enlisted in military service as an army scientist and engineer. There had long been talks in the physics community of the possibility of high energy weapons, and Arnold felt confident that with proper military funding, his expertise would yield the results his homeland needed to win. 
History would come to paint the actions of Arnold’s nation as inhumane and without justification (a framing he would refute considerably much later when in private and among trusted colleagues). But at the time of his enlistment, Arnold did not actually which way care about why his country had started the war. Nor did he care to verify if they maintained any kind of moral justification for any of their actions. All his blind eye had seen was an opportunity for application of his research and the glory that came with it. 
Upon assignment, he approached his superiors with prepared notes, models, and plans for the weapon he envisioned. He’d poured over the math and the physics that laid the foundation for his designs. Save for some brief iteration, Arnold guaranteed them that the weapon would not only work, but it would ensure victory. 
To his dismay, high command dismissed him without consideration and assigned him to radio transmission interception. Arnold would stay in this role for the rest of his enlistment fermenting in resentment. 
A few war torn years transpired and the enemy finished development on their own version of what would have been Arnold’s great weapon. With it they won the war. They credited a group of their own scientists and engineers for its research and development. But an anonymous package that had arrived early in their process conveniently went unmentioned. The notes, models, and plans contained within had laid the foundation of what they would eventually develop. 
After the war, that same country held war trials. They doled out punishments for what Arnold would privately describe as “the mere crime of losing a war on a global scale” (he always failed to acknowledge the war crimes and industrial level human rights violations they had committed). Arnold was put on trial briefly. But the tribunal deemed him an insignificant cog in a much larger machine. Having received no more than a slap on the wrist, He promptly returned to university and finished out his doctorate. 
Arnold finished his thesis in what would have been a significant development in high energy physics, had much of the same results not been discovered during the creation of the great aforementioned weapon. Nonetheless, his results were considered adequate for a doctoral title and he was offered a research position at a university in a town not far from where he had studied. For Arnold, however, it was too little too late, and he declined. He opted instead for a new land; one that had not only managed to win the war, but also produce unprecedented economic opportunity from it. 
* * *
In the new world Arnold set himself up at a private institution in the northeast. He was awarded ample freedom and funding to conduct research of his choice. A particular group of scientists and engineers making significant advancements in electronics and computing piqued his interest. So he integrated with them and together they set about trying to develop a new computational alternative to vacuum tubes.  
They succeeded, and Arnold cemented his place in history as a major contributor to the invention of the transistor. 
Arnold had hoped his contributions would bring him recognition, glory, and fortune. But he would come out of his tenure with nothing but disappointment. The laboratory maintained the rights and patents to all of his and his team’s work, and while the team memebers retained the credit, not many saw any financial returns.  As a result, most of the members of the team left to start their own companies. They avoided any legal repercussions by modifying and improving on their original design, to much success. Arnold followed suit, determined to capture the fortune and recognition entitled to him. To his good fortune, he was massively successful.
Over the subsequent years, Arnold Sargot went on to build one of the largest and most successful technology companies in the world, and he came to rank among the richest people on the planet. Yet, he remained unsatisfied. Among the technology elite, he was recognized for his achievements, but often he would find himself at a dinner with high level members of other industries, and they would not know who he was nor what he did. What he had achieved in terms of wealth, he still felt he lacked in glory, fame, and acknowledgement. 
To remedy this he directed his company and fortune towards development of high impact, high stakes projects. “Shoot for the moon,” he told them. He founded a subsidiary laboratory to fund research and development of these endeavors. After some time the lab delivered, producing exciting new technology. Sargot’s company innovated across many fields including agricultural cultivation, climatization, and genetic sequencing. They released new products that revolutionized all industries. With this work they quickly established their credibility as a company capable of doing what no one else thought yet possible. 
On top of that, they crafted a reputation as a group more interested in advancing humanity than making a profit. Many of their discoveries were made publicly available through free and open publishing of their schematics. Their genetic sequencing method was one such example. It was published in an open scientific journal, free for anyone to understand, verify, and use without having to interface with Sargot’s proprietary technology. It was often cited as evidence of Sargot’s benevolence. 
Their grand achievement, and what finally launched Sargot to grand levels of fame, however, was their discovery of time travel. 
The announcement of a successful trial came after a few years of the laboratory’s founding. Not long after the announcement, they presented proof to the public by showcasing something they claimed to have brought back from the past: a Neanderthal. 
Over the course of a few years The Sargot Company erected a structure that made use of almost every major technology and resource at their disposal. They constructed a campus housed by a massive climate controlled dome. At the center of the campus a habitat was built that simulated the exact conditions of the neanderthal’s original environment. Secrecy surrounded the project during its construction period. Once it had finished, however, The Sargot Company opened the habitat for public visitation as a natural science exhibit. 
The public and the media fixated on everything surrounding The Sargot Company’s neanderthal, and Arnold Sargot launched to celebrity status. The media heralded him as the greatest mind of his generation. His critics took on the opposite position, deriding him and his company. Controversy encircled the seeming lack of proof of the time travel technology. And the physics community grew divided around his claims. 
Many contested him, citing theoretical research that indicated the impossibility of time travel. Others were more open to the possibility of it, but urged him to make the details of the technology public. Most thought he eventually would, since the company had a reputation for openness and transparency. 
The company ignored the requests and buried the criticism under rhetoric about the potential for abuse by bad actors. They did however allow an unbiased third party to sequence the DNA of the neanderthal in order to prove their claims of who or what he was. The whole event became a spectacle, and the public was invited to The Habitat to witness the entire process. The auditors ran the sequence and concluded that The Sargot Company’s claims were in fact correct. The DNA of the man in their exhibit was that of Homo Neanderthalensis.

Arnold Sargot had a secret. Lucy and Tim were staring right at it in disgust. 
* * *
Mrs. Graham lectured, rattling off about the significance of some historical artifact that was once discovered in the Egyptian desert. Normally Lucy would be engrossed, but today she wasn’t listening. Her attention lay in the informational packet they’d received at the beginning of class. 
A man standing in a gray tailored suit stared at her through the print. His eyes followed her every which way no matter where she held the packet from. He looked to be in his mid fifties. A thick head of formerly blonde hair had begun its transition into a shade that matched his suit. Under the image a subscript read: “Business magnate Arnold Sargot inaugurates his new ‘Terrarium of Humanity’, home of the neanderthal”.
“Do you know what year that was, Lucy?” Mrs. Graham’s voice broke in.
“I’m sorry?”
“Do you know what year Shelley published Ozymandias?” Mrs. Graham said again, “The poem we just read out loud.”
“I’m sorry Mrs. Graham. I don’t.”
“1818. Lucy I’m glad you’re excited about the visit to The Terrarium tomorrow, but the informational packet was for you to read at home. Now please put it away and pay attention. There may or may not be a pop quiz over this on Monday.”


* * *


“You didn’t read the packet??” Lucy said. 
        “This trip gets me out of class. I don’t need to go looking for another reason to want to be on it.” Tim responded. He adjusted his backpack against the wall of the school bus and leaned back on it, stretching his legs out across the seat. 
“It had so much important information! Details about The Terrarium, The Habitat, Arnold Sargot himself. The man is brilliant. A genius!”
        “Oh yeah I did kind of skim the blurb on him. Isn’t he some kind of fascist?”
Lucy scowled at him. “If you had read it properly, you would know that he was forced into the military by his home country. They were fascists. But not him. His true passion was academics: science and engineering.”
“Oh right. And Cameron Johnson was forced by the rest of the football team to shove me in a locker last week. That’s why I was the one that got detention for it,”
“You got detention because Mr. Paulson saw you try to punch him,”
        “Whatever,”
“Anyways, Sargot wasn’t a fascist. That’s why he came here after the war. He rejected everything to do with fascism. He was inspired by our ideals,”
Tim squinted his eyebrows at Lucy, then rolled his eyes away.
“He didn’t even contribute anything to the fascists. The trials after the war showed that he had no involvement in weapons development. He was some kind of radio operator. But it was here that he helped invent the transistor. And so many other things!” Lucy said.  “Shit, Tim, time travel, tell me that’s not unbelievable!”
“Do you even know what a transistor is?”
“You’re impossible,”        
        Just then the bus lurched forward to a stop. Lucy looked out her window to see a large glass dome at least six or seven stories high. A metal lattice crawled the underside supporting the glass. Canopies of green foliage peeked out from within. 
The students clustered and poured from the bus to congregate in front of it. Mrs. Graham shuffled off right behind them and herded them together.
        “A real neanderthal that they brought back from the past,” Lucy said.
        Tim stood unimpressed. He watched Mrs. Graham trail around the group and make her way to the front.
        “The terrarium is supposed to perfectly simulate the conditions of the habitat from when they brought him from,”
        “They kidnapped this Neanderthal from his home, and dropped him into a cage for us to entertain ourselves pretending he’s at home?”  Tim said, “So we’re at a zoo.”
        “It’s a science exhibit and research center,”
        “It’s a fancy zoo,”
        “He’s the closest genetic ancestor to our species. We’re just trying to learn more about him,”
        “Oh I see, it’s not a zoo,”
        “I’m glad you understand,”
        “It’s a prison,”
        “No it’s not a– God. It’s an unprecedented scientific achievement,”
        The double doors at the base of the dome swung open and a woman stepped out. Her hair streaked down past her shoulders, bleached blonde. The sleeve of her pantsuit seemed on the verge of tearing when she raised her hand and waived at the group. Mrs. Graham approached her and the students followed. 
Lucy studied the woman. The stiffness of her wardrobe infected her aura all the way down to her smile. Designer heels fixed to her feet lifted her an inch and a half above her regular height. She hung her left hand down her side gripping a plastic bag filled with white cards and lanyards. Lucy locked eyes with the woman and felt her temperature drop and her legs lock in place. Paralysis gripped her like prey in the glare of a viper. Then the woman looked away and addressed the group.
        “Welcome Children! My name is Amy Hillborough. I am the executive assistant of Mr. Arnold Sargot, founder and CEO of the Sargot Company and the genius behind the exhibit you have come here to see today, The Terrarium!”
        “Children? She knows we’re Seniors, right?” Tim said to Lucy out of the corner of his mouth. Lucy glared at him. Tim turned forward and pursed his lips. 
        Amy Hillborough passed the bag she was holding to Mrs. Graham. 
        “I will be your guide for the day! We’re giving all of you special access key cards. This will let each of you enter the terrarium with me and give you entry to the restricted rooms we will be visiting. Please make sure you grab the card that has your name on it and scan it before entering The Terrarium, as well as any of the other rooms we enter. We do this to keep track of everyone that enters our facilities so that we can keep our guests, employees, and The Neanderthal safe.”
        The bag made its way around until it got to Lucy and Tim. The two fished out their tags and hung the lanyard around their necks.
        Amy Hillborough continued speaking for a few more minutes. She gave her required legal lecture on liability and safety before finally inviting the school group to follow her into the facility. 
        The Terrarium welcomed them into a wide open space. Canopies of dense greenery, foliage, and all sorts of plants filled the building. Seating areas and work spaces and lounges interspersed throughout, mingling with the gardens. Many of them were occupied by people working and socializing. Lucy took in the natural light let in by the glass dome. She pictured herself spending a whole afternoon in the building reading and lounging or even working on homework without complaint. 
        In the center of the building stood a wall that ran the entirety of the dome forming a ring. The wall reached the height of two stories, well below the dome’s ceiling, but high enough that someone atop it could view the whole of The Terrarium. It consisted of a deep black stone that contrasted the rest of the colors in the space. 
        Amy Hillborough stopped the group in front of the only features that broke the monotony of the wall, a set of double doors with an RFID scanner and a steel staircase that crawled up the side of the monument. 
        “Welcome to The Terrarium. Please follow me up these stairs so I can give you an overview and history of this facility that we are oh so proud of. The visuals from the top make the lesson much better.”
        The students formed a line and followed Amy Hillborough up the stairs single file. 
The top of the wall spanned the width of a six lane highway.  The deep black of the wall’s sides continued across its upper edge. From their vantage, the students could see how it formed a ring spanning The Terrarium. Viewing telescopes molded in brass stood in uniform spacing all around. They faced inwards for visitors to get a better view of the area the wall surrounded.
“If you look over the edge of the railing behind me, you’ll see what we call ‘The Habitat’,” Amy Hillborough said. “It makes up the majority of The Terrarium, and is the home of the Neanderthal.”
Lucy gazed over the landscape that lay in front of her, filled with awe. 
She heard Amy Hillborough ask, “Can anyone here that did their homework tell me how The Habitat was designed and organized?”, and her hand shot straight into the air. Mrs. Hillborough looked over the crowd and, seeing no other volunteers, called on Lucy.
“Yes, young lady?”
“The Habitat was specially engineered to simulate the original environment that the Neanderthal was found in. The side we are standing on is more of a warm temperate forest, but the other side of The Habitat is far colder and made to be like the environment of the ice ages,” Lucy said, feeling very proud of herself for having read the booklet. She glanced over at Tim. He rolled his eyes.
“Someone read up before coming. That is correct. We developed special climate regulation technology that allows us to modify the temperature in a gradient across the exhibit. In this way we are able to simulate the full range of climate the neanderthal experienced back in his time. We find that he typically likes to spend his time on the side with forest, however, as it is far warmer.”
Lucy looked out over the landscape in front of her. At the far end she thought she could just make out the features of a small man-made glacier. She was amazed and overwhelmed by the ingenuity of it all. Right below on the side of the wall she was standing, a beautiful and lush forest spread out as if it were native to the soil itself. Never before had this level of environmental engineering been achieved, at least not at this scale. 
Amy Hillborough’s voice faded back in, “Follow me back down to the ground level and we will enter The Ring to see if we can get a glimpse of the neanderthal himself from a safe, but closer distance.”
The group descended back down the same stairs they’d come up from. Amy led them to the front of the double doors they’d seen earlier. She scanned her key card and the doors unlocked. Propping one of them open with her foot, she gestured for the group to enter. At Amy’s behest, each student scanned their key card as they went in. 
Warm lights lit the room. The deep black of the outer wall evidently consumed the inside of The Ring as well. The warmth of the light had nowhere to bounce back off of and the whole space felt like that of a cave surrounding Lucy.  The door closed behind the group and Amy Hillborough phased through the crowd, appearing next to a new door on their left. 
“The entirety of the ring can be walked through by a series of hallways that lead to many different rooms and offices where we conduct much of our work. The door we are about to go through and the door mirroring it on the other side both lead to the main hallway that connects all of The Ring. The door opposite of where we came in is the first of several that allow our scientists and employees direct access to The Habitat!” 
Lucy spoke up, “Are we going to be able to go into The Habitat as well?”
“Oh goodness no!” Amy Hillborough said, “It is far too dangerous for us to go into. Although The Neanderthal is a species of human, he is quite savage and uncivilized. Approaching him directly would put all of you children in danger.”
“Again, Seniors in high school,” Lucy heard Tim say in a tone far too low for anyone else to have parsed. The deep red shade of Lucy’s face kept her silent from there on out.
Amy led the group again through the new set of doors and into a white, brightly lit hallway that contrasted the room they had just stepped out of. They walked down a long length of the hallway passing several closed doors. Each door consisted of the same glossy white shade that constituted the walls and ceilings of the corridor. If it were not for the break from the door handles and the gaps between the door and the wall, the whole space would blend into itself in monotony. Most of the doors were closed shut, but at one point Lucy saw what looked to be a supply closet that hadn’t closed all the way. Otherwise, however, the monotony continued, uniform.
Finally, Amy stopped at a door, identical to all the others, and swung it open after scanning her key card. The students flooded into the new chamber at her beckoning. 
Lucy stepped into the space and got a blast of humidity and warm air. The room was long. It stretched far along around the bend of the ring. The inner side had no wall, instead a metal gate followed the length of the room. It was the only thing separating the group from The Habitat. 
“Please feel free to grab a map!” Amy Hilborough said. She gestured at a stack of paper brochures sitting in a cubby on the wall beside her. Lucy walked over and grabbed one. She opened up the accordion folding to reveal a printed figure detailing the different areas of The Terrarium. The subsections within The Habitat were carefully labeled as well. There were small text boxes describing the different ecologies found within, and even blurbs showing where the neanderthal usually hunted and slept. 
Amy Hillborough spoke again, “They usually don’t come to the outer edges, but The Habitat is filled with wild game similar to what Neanderthals hunted and ate during their time. This is the primary source of food for our neanderthal. Like I mentioned when we were top side, we wanted to recreate the conditions of his original habitat as closely as possible.” 
Lucy stared out beyond the fence. The same green space that they saw above spread out in front of her. Layers of plants sprouted out from moist dirt and stacked up on each other. The life force from the forest propagated out into the room encapsulating her. Its warmth hit her in waves consistent with the beating of her own heart. She felt almost that it was pulling her in, calling her to walk into the depths of the brush. It planted a desperation in her, a yearning for the wild. She needed to venture in.
“Lucy, are you coming?” Tim’s voice broke in. The group had moved away about 50 meters following Amy Hillborough’s lead around the bend. Tim had come back to grab her when he realized she’d stayed behind. Lucy’s face was right up against the fence. She’d drifted up to the edge of the habitat.
“Yeah.. sorry,” Lucy said. She blinked a few times and stared back at the habitat, but the feeling had gone. With the map clutched in her fingers she trotted back to the group behind Tim. 
* * *
“... Now I can’t guarantee we’ll see him, but he does from time to time venture out to these edges. This side of the habitat is his favorite since it is warm and lush with plants, and we can sometimes lure him out here with food that we disperse in the area,” Lucy heard Amy Hillborough lecturing once she was within earshot. “From here on out we will want to be as quiet as we can so as not to scare him away!”
The group kept walking along the edge of the gate. Everyone stayed quiet, everyone stayed attentive.The slightest breeze or rustle in the leaves would quickly hook their attention and they would stand still peering in, waiting. But nothing would come of it and they’d continue their stroll. Five minutes went by, then ten, fifteen, twenty. Mrs. Graham became impressed by how quiet and still her class managed to stay during the time. 
Thirty minutes went by and the group was about to call it quits when Lucy stopped in her tracks. She saw him. Just his eyes, but that was enough. They were fixated on her, and she on them. She felt her adrenaline spike and sweat beads roll down her palms. A prey stuck in the gaze of a predator, she felt a sense of gratitude for the fence rooted in front of her.
Tim noticed her staring and followed her gaze until he saw him too. In a wave the same effect rippled over the rest of the group. The students stood silent and still staring at the figure that materialized out of the forest in front of them. 
He didn’t walk on his feet up right, he hunched over and moved in a way that resembled a hop combined with a waddle. His hands hung down in front of him to steady him. They balanced him and pushed him forward. He gazed out over the crowd inspecting them. 
 Lucy thought he’d be hairier. The image she’d pictured had more so resembled a chimp, but now she found herself staring at a person. He was human. She knew that, of course; that he was human. But she’d never internalized it. She’d created a separation, he was other, he was a neanderthal, she was human. He was to be studied for our benefit. But now she was seeing it in real life, with her own eyes, and the grand idea of The Terrarium she had created in her head melted away. Mud and grime covered his body, but he was otherwise naked. Deep scars ran down his back and navel. Lucy touched her stomach. She looked at his eyes and saw fear hiding behind savagery. She backed up and looked at the fence and then the wall behind her. They were moving closer together. Her heart rate spiked. With each beat the walls grew closer. She was imprisoned. She was stuck in this room. He was stuck in this room. In this habitat. He was stuck. This wasn’t a research facility, it was a zoo, a prison. 
“You were right,” she said, just soft enough that only Tim could hear.
“What?” Tim asked.
“You were right, this is a prison. Look at him. He’s terrified.”
Tim turned to look at the neanderthal. His muscles were flexed ready to lunge or run at any moment. But something kept him there. That’s when he saw it. The way the neanderthal looked at Amy Hillborough. He kept eyeing her with every movement, as if seeking approval. The crowd clearly scared him, but something about Amy being there scared him even more. It scared him too much to leave. Lucy saw it too. Amy Hillborough kept her eyes on the neanderthal without looking away once. A soft sadistic smile sat on her face. Finally, she looked away and back at the group of students. The neanderthal saw his opportunity and sprinted off back into the forest. 
The student group released a collective breath. 
“Well wasn’t that quite the experience?” Amy Hillborough said, “I hope you’ll leave here with a feeling of awe, that was certainly our goal!”
“Lucy, are you okay?” Mrs. Graham asked, her face heavy with concern. Lucy was standing behind the rest of the crowd, her back pressed against the wall. The color had drained from her face. She glanced at Mrs. Graham then over at Tim whose eyes too were darting back and forth from Lucy to Mrs. Graham.
“Yes, Mrs. Graham, sorry, I think I was just so …awestruck by what just happened,” Lucy said. She stepped forward and gave her teacher a smile then averted her gaze. 
“Yes, it was certainly quite exciting! I know how interested you were in this trip. I’m so glad you got a chance to witness the neanderthal in person!” Mrs. Graham said.
“Yeah, me too,” Lucy said, then walked over to Tim. She gave him a light push on the back to lead him back into the crowd of students with her.
Amy Hillborough made some final remarks and gestured for the group to follow her back where they’d come in from. 
“What was that?” Tim asked once they were out of Mrs. Graham’s earshot.
“We have to do something,” Lucy said.
“What?”
“This is inhumane,”
“Yeah I told you. This place is a prison for that man,”
“We have to get him out,”
“I’m sorry, what?”
Lucy didn’t answer. Mrs. Graham had drifted back over to them, trying to corral her students like a sheepdog and usher them out the door. Lucy and Tim kept quiet and followed suit, exiting back into the white hallway. The two walked along with the group, Mrs. Graham not too far behind keeping an eye on her class. They made their way down the hallway, back towards the end they had come in through. 
Lucy looked around while they walked. When the front door got closer, Mrs. Graham went around them. She pushed ahead to the front of the group to lead the class out. Just then, Lucy again noticed the closet door that wasn’t fully shut up ahead. She glanced at Mrs. Graham to check that her back was turned away from them, and grabbed Tim’s arm pulling him into the closet with her. 
“What the hell are you doing?” Tim asked through his teeth beneath a wide eyed stare.
“Shhhh,” Lucy said. She slapped her hand over his mouth then gently closed the door in front of them. Tim pulled her arm down to get her hand off, but she placed it right back. This went on back and forth several times until Lucy was satisfied that the class had probably exited.
“Lucy, what are we doing in here?”
“I don’t know, it was an impulse decision. But I don’t think anyone has come back to look for us so they probably don’t think we’re missing.”
“Yes I also figure that is the case. Why. are. we. in. here. though? Is this your idea of doing something? What are we going to do from here?”
“I didn’t think it through, but I had to do something.”
“There are so many other things we could have done. We could organize a protest from the outside, we could reach out to a newspaper and tell them about what we saw, we could contact the police. So many other things that don’t involve us being trapped inside a psycho science zoo. What do you figure we’ll do from here? Break him out?”
“Yeah. Why not? Let’s break him out.”
“Oh my god you’ve lost your mind. You are the smartest person I know and somehow you went and did the stupidest thing I can think of. And you dragged me into it too.”
Lucy stared at him. There was a softness in her gaze, a sorrow. Tim looked back at her. Then looked down and put his hand to his forehead, gripping his temples.
“Okay. What’s the plan?”
“I didn’t really think that far ahead,”
        “We just wait here until everyone leaves? Hope no one sees us? And then break a literal neanderthal out of its zoo?”
“I …yeah. That’s a good plan,”
“No. You’ve gone crazy. We’re going to get in so much trouble. Let’s just leave now, say we got lost, and maybe we can get away with just detention or something,” Tim said, reaching for the door handle. Lucy slammed his hand down. 
“Tim, we have to do something,”
Tim looked at her again, and finally relented. He knew better than to try to dissuade her when her mind was made up. Plus, she was right.
“Okay. We’ll wait it out and figure out what to do next,”
He looked down at his watch. 
3:45
Tim leaned back against the wall and slid down it. He wrapped his arms around his knees and lay his head onto them. Lucy joined him, laying her head on his shoulder. She stared at the watch and let the minutes fall away like water dripping from a faucet.

Lucy jolted awake. She couldn’t see a thing, but could feel Tim sitting next to her fast asleep.
“Tim, wake up,” She said, nudging his shoulder.
“What’s going on, where are we?” Tim said with sleep still on his tongue.
“We’re in that utility closet from earlier. In The Terrarium,”
Lucy grabbed Tim’s wrist and looked at the time.
9:45
She stood up and gave him her hand for him to follow. The two of them stretched out and looked at the door. Their breathing shortened. Lucy’s vision was tunneling. She reached out and put her hand on the door handle and gently pried the door open to a crack. The hallway on the other side was dark,with only dim lighting coming from its ends. From what she could tell there was no one in it so she swung the door open and the two stepped out.
Lucy took the lead. She figured they couldn’t get into the habitat from the caged room they’d been in earlier, but maybe they could manage a different way in. Earlier, Amy had mentioned that there was a door to get in from the first chamber they had entered within The Ring. She figured they could try from that direction for now. Tim followed her close behind. She could feel the nerves emanating from him and did her best to suppress her own. 
The two walked through the pristine white hallway, taking care not to make any unnecessary loud noises. Every little echo they heard paralyzed them. They’d stop for a second, deathly aware of how loud their breathing sounded. But nothing and no one would appear so they continued their tread forward. The walk down the hallway did not actually take very long, but the constant stopping and being on edge made them feel like they had walked for an hour. Finally, they reached the door that only a few hours before, the rest of their class had walked out through. 
Sweat beaded on Lucy’s hand when she reached for the handle. She had to pause and wipe it on her pant leg before actually trying the door. Fortunately, it did not lock from the inside and she was able to gain access to exit the hallway. She pushed it open a hair and listened for movement on the other side. Hearing nothing, she widened the opening incrementally until she could poke her head out to have a look. The chamber lay empty. The two trespassers stepped through back into the black room that they had come in through earlier.
A black door stood in the wall, opposite the exit back to the main lobby. Lucy walked over to it and tried the handle.
“Damn! It’s locked,” She turned back to face Tim. He scrunched his face when he looked back at her, thinking. Suddenly, his face lit up.
“The key card,”
Lucy widened her eyes. “You think it will work?”
Tim shrugged. Lucy pulled her lanyard off of her neck and hovered the card over the RFID scanner.

The door unlocked. Lucy looked at Tim with surprise then pulled the door handle. It gave way to a new hallway, fairly short, with another door on the opposite end. The pair walked through, embedding caution in every step. Lucy scanned her key card again for the new door and they stepped through once more.
This time they walked into a clear box of a room, the wall and ceiling crafted out of glass held up by metal support beams. It was designed as an airlock of sorts, the last barrier from the wild that Sargot had created. You could stand there and feel nearly immersed in The Habitat, while still maintaining safety.  A door had been crafted into the glass. It had a manual deadbolt, no RFID. Lucy took a deep and final breath then unlocked the door and stepped out of the doorway into The Habitat.

Lucy pulled out her map and stretched it open on a nearby stone. She gestured to Tim and pointed at several key points demarcated on the pamphlet. 
“So here is where we just came in from,” She said. “And here is the most common area that he tends to sleep in.” She swept her finger from a point on the edge of The Habitat out to a point at the edge of the forested area. 
“How far is that in the real world?” Tim asked.
“According to the scale, about 3 or 4 miles out. Should not be too bad,”
“Okay. I don’t want to be here longer than we need to,”
Lucy nodded and folded up the map before placing it in her back pocket. The two of them set off. They hadn’t walked too far before they noticed a slightly treaded path that seemed to head in the same direction they were trying to go. They pushed through brush and leaves, taking care to watch their step so as not to get caught in mud. 
Shadows stretched from the edges of the path. The branches swayed under the dim lighting from above, their leaves clawing at them but never quite reaching. Rustling sounded off in the distance every so often. Lucy and Tim could feel adrenaline pulsing in their temples keeping them awake and alert. With no compass to guide them, they hoped the path they were on would lead them at least somewhat close to their target. 
Suddenly, a rustling behind them began to crescendo. Something was tearing through the woods getting closer. The pair stopped in their path and turned around ready to bolt. The rustling got louder and more chaotic. Branches snapped and dust clouded, and out of the bushes a group of deer burst straight at Lucy and Tim. 
The two threw themselves to the side, breaking apart and giving the stampede just enough room to run through without flattening them. The deer continued on, trampling plants and laying the foundations of a new trail into the depth of the forest.
“What the hell,” Tim said. 
“Amy said they packed this place with wild animals, but I didn’t think it was a whole pack of them,” Lucy said.
“It looked like they were running from something,” Tim said. “I don’t know if I want to find out what it was that scared them.”
Lucy looked out into the void of the forest and felt the darkness stretching out to grab her.
“Come on,” she said. “Let’s keep going.” She turned around and led Tim back on to the trail.
Their journey continued, and they ventured deeper into The Habitat. Although they continued to stay vigilant, they did not notice the silent stalker that had started to tail them. 


At the end of their path the forest opened up to a small clearing at the foot of a cliff. An assortment of sticks and foliage held together by mud were propped against the cliffside, clearly forming a primitive shelter. Lucy and Tim stopped at the edge of the forest and looked around, scanning for potential danger. The space stood still and calm. 
Tim took the first step towards the shelter. Lucy hesitated, suddenly nervous, but after a second followed behind him. When they were about 50 feet away they stopped. Tim put his finger to his lips, signaling Lucy to stay quiet. He padded laterally to scope out who or what might be in the shelter. Lucy pressed her lips together. She eyed his movement between glances at the woods.  
Tim closed the remaining distance, taking care to be gentle and quiet with each step. He had to hunch over to ensure he would fit through the shelter opening. Lucy felt her nerves about to burst watching him pull aside the leaves that marked the entrance. Tim stuck his head through.
“There’s no one here,” He said. 
“Oh shoot,” Lucy sprinted over.
“Maybe he’s out hunting, or at a different shelter,” She said. “Or maybe they’re doing experiments on him.”
Tim stepped back out of the shelter. 
“What do we do now?”
Lucy started to answer, but stopped when she noticed a rustling in the woods. She turned to look, and saw a hunched over creature materialize from the shadows. He moved in a way that resembled a hop combined with a waddle.  His hands hung down in front of him to steady him. He stopped at the edge of the woods to stare them down.
“Tim,”
“Yeah, I see him,”
The neanderthal circled around them, never breaking his gaze. He took his time with every step as if casting judgment on whether or not they were a threat. Tim and Lucy stood frozen, watching him pace side to side. Lucy took the initiative and stepped forward.
“Hi. Excuse me. Sir?”
The neanderthal backed away and scurried towards the woods.
“We’re not here to hurt you.  We’re here to help,” Lucy said. “We’re friends.”
The neanderthal cocked his head to the side as if considering what Lucy had just said. Lucy relaxed some. She felt like something was getting through. She was about to take another step forward when a branch snapping sounded off to the side. The sound triggered something in the neanderthal, and he rushed straight at Lucy. 
Neither Lucy nor Tim had any time to react. The neanderthal was surprisingly fast. Lucy took a step back and started tripping over herself. Right before she fell backwards, the neanderthal reached her and grabbed her by the waist. He slung her over his shoulder and continued barrelling straight ahead.
Tim managed to trip over himself backwards as everything unfolded and fell onto his back on the ground. 
“Oh shit,” he thought when he watched the neanderthal grab Lucy like some kind of prize to be captured. Before he could react, a torrent of deer ambushed through right in front of him, straight through the exact spot where Lucy had been standing. Tim watched the chaos blow up clouds of dust, making it hard to keep track of his own safety, let alone Lucy’s.
When everything cleared and the deer had made off to safety back to the forest, Tim scrambled to his feet. He looked around, scouring the area around him. Fight or flight had kicked in and fight was winning. He was ready to risk his life to save Lucy’s. Fortunately, when the dust fully settled, he got a view of where Lucy was. 
The neanderthal had taken her over to the side of his shelter, and was setting her down. Tim bounded to where they were and put himself between Lucy and the neanderthal. The neanderthal backed up. He had returned to his hunched stance.
“Are you okay?” Tim asked Lucy, never taking his eyes off of the neanderthal.
“Yeah, it’s okay Tim,” She said. “ I almost got squashed, but thankfully he lifted me out of the way. He saved my life.”
Upon hearing Lucy say that, Tim relaxed. 
“Yeah, thank you for that,” Tim said, directing the remark at the neanderthal. The neanderthal did not respond, and continued watching them.
Lucy stepped around Tim and sat down on her knees. She brought her hands to her chest. 
“Yes. Thank you for saving my life,” She said. “We are friends, and we’re actually here to help you too.” She extended her hands out when she said this, gesturing to him. The neanderthal did not respond.
“Can you understand me?” Lucy asked. Again, she received no response. Lucy looked over at Tim, her expression asking him what they should do. He shrugged and shook his head. Lucy stopped to think. After a few seconds her face lit up.
“Your snacks! The beef jerky,” She said, sticking her palm out at Tim. Tim matched her expression and swung his backpack over to the front. He dug through until he found a plastic bag filled with his favorite, pepper dried jerky and tossed Lucy the snack.
Lucy pulled a piece of jerky out and held the offering in front of her.
“It’s good, I promise”
The neanderthal stayed on alert, but approached Lucy’s outstretched hand. He hovered his hand towards her’s. Then, suddenly, he swiped the jerky out of her fingers and scurried back to safety. 
He sniffed the jerky, and seemed to deem it trustworthy enough to take a small bite. His eyes widened with that small piece leading him to scarf the rest of the strip down. He turned over and galloped back to Lucy. After pausing for a second and looking at Tim, he stretched his palm out at them. Lucy grabbed another strip and put it in his hand.
The neanderthal took the jerky and ran off again, but this time not quite as far. He ate the snack and was back in front of Lucy once again.
This time when she handed him another piece, he didn’t run off. He stayed, crouched down, and ate it next to the two friends. Tim sat down next to Lucy and studied him as he ate. 
“If you come with us, we can give you more jerky,” Lucy said to the neanderthal. “And we can take you somewhere safe, away from here.”
The neanderthal finished his piece and looked at her. He stretched his hand out again. Lucy handed him another piece before standing back up. At this, the neanderthal backed up a few steps and watched her. She put her hands out in front of her.
“It’s okay we’re just gonna start heading back to the trail. We can give you more jerky once we’re on our way,”
Lucy motioned for Tim and he followed her back to the trail head. The neanderthal finished his jerky and watched them walk until they stopped back at the edge of the woods. They paused and stared at him. He stared back for a moment, but shortly after galloped over to where they were and held his hand out. 
        Lucy handed him a piece of jerky.
        “We have to get him to come with us without wanting too much jerky or we might run out before we get back to the exit,” Lucy said to Tim.
        “Start giving him smaller pieces for now, and then we can–,” Tim stopped short. The neanderthal had taken the piece of jerky from Lucy and started down the trail himself. He stopped a few paces ahead of them and looked back as if to ask what was taking them so long.
Tim jogged up after him.
        “Wait. Can you understand us?” Tim asked him. The neanderthal didn’t answer. He just looked at Tim for a moment then continued down the path. Tim and Lucy shrugged at each other and followed behind.
        After a few hundred feet of walking the neanderthal stopped again and stared at Lucy with his hand outstretched, this time giving a grunt. Lucy broke a strip in half and handed it to him. He took his time to eat then continued his trek through the woods. This process continued every couple hundred feet. Each time Lucy broke off smaller and smaller pieces to try to ration the jerky, but in time they made it back to the exit before running out. 


The glass box lumbered over them when they finally made it back. Relief washed over the two makeshift rescuers when they saw it. They rushed to the door and flung it open. They bounded into the room and started for the next door when they noticed it was just the two of them in step. Lucy looked back to see the neanderthal paused at the door. He was pressed into the ground, his fingers and toes rooting in. Across his face the struggle of the habitat fought the terror of the glass box. 
“I promise, nothing is going to happen to you. Please come with us,” Lucy said to him. “We’ll take care of you.”
The neanderthal would not budge. He did not even acknowledge that Lucy had spoken to him. He stayed paralyzed, crouched beneath the glass room, staring up at it, cowering.
“Lucy, here, dump the rest of the bag,” Tim cupped his hands and held them out at Lucy.
“Are you sure? What if we need some later?”
“We’ll come up with something else, but right now we have to get him out of here, and this is the best idea we have,”
Lucy nodded, though her forehead spelled out her apprehension. Nonetheless, she dumped the rest of the bag into Tim’s cupped fingers. 
Tim approached the neanderthal with his handful of jerky, stopping just short of the doorway. 
“Please you need to come with us,” Tim held his hand out in offering. The neanderthal approached, but the apprehension stayed covering his face. He took the jerky from Tim’s hand and burned it down to quell his anxiety.
Lucy took the opportunity to advance back through the door into The Ring. Tim followed suit, and with some good fortune the neanderthal crossed in on his tail. Finally back inside, Lucy let out a sigh of relief taking a beat to catch her breath. However, the break was cut short when the group heard a rattle at the door handle on the opposite side of the room.
Acting on instinct, Tim sprung into action and grabbed Lucy and the neanderthal by their arms. He sprinted to one of the doors leading back into the ring and pulled the group through it into the hallway with him. In parallel, the door from the lobby swung open in time for the trespassers to make eye contact with a security guard doing his rounds.
“Hey! You’re not supposed to be in here!” the security guard said. The kids didn’t stay behind to listen. Tim led them in a dead sprint through the blinding white hallways. The security guard chased after them. 
Tim could hear the lumbering steps of the guard echoing behind them. He didn’t dare look back to see how close they might be, he just held on tight to his partners’ wrists and dashed ahead, zipping through bends and bouncing around corners. Only when he could hear the footsteps fading away behind him did he dare to look back. Just over his shoulder he saw the guard lagging behind, failing to match their speed. Taking advantage of this, Tim rounded one final corner and started pulling on door handles. The first two he tried didn’t budge, but he got lucky on the third one and it swung open. He pulled his crew in behind him and closed the door, taking care not to slam it.
Light from the hallway swept the floor of the room through the crack below the door. Tim and Lucy watched it carefully. After several minutes they heard the footsteps of the security guard crescendo up the hallway. When the sound reached the room, the guard cast his shadow under the door as if to search for the intruders. Lucy couldn't will herself to breathe. She looked at Tim with pools of fear in her eyes. He squeezed her hand in reassurance. The both of them glanced at the neanderthal and motioned their fingers to their lips for him to stay still and quiet. They figured he must have somehow understood the gesture or maybe his survival instincts took over because he stayed crouched next to them, keeping as quiet as they were. Lucy’s lungs ached from nearing their limit when the shadow and the footsteps finally receded down the hallway. She let out the breath she’d been holding in relief. 
Tim and Lucy backed into the room away from the door. This was as good a place as any to formulate a plan while they had some time. Lucy turned around and took in her surroundings. Tim pressed ahead to explore the space. The sides of the room held a set of staircases. Each of them crawled up the wall, one mirroring the other, onto a second story loft that overlooked the room. Whatever lay on the second story was not easy to see without venturing up onto the second floor. The ground floor itself was expansive, however. It stretched deep in front of Tm. At its center several tables had been arranged in two perfectly paired columns. Six tables in total, three on each side. Stools stood assembled equally perfect around the tables. Papers lay scattered on top of the tables.
The walls ran lined with shelves and filing cabinets and continued far into the depths of the space. Tim hovered over and stalked the labels on the nearest shelf. He pulled a folder full of documents off the shelf and shuffled through the pages. Lucy sat down on the floor next to the neanderthal and watched Tim scan the documents. She saw Tim’s face descend into concern with each new folder he pulled off the shelf. He would pull a new document down, scan it and tuck it under his arm. Finally, the stack he was carrying proved to be too much. Tim hobbled over to the table stacked with papers and dumped his plunders on top. 
When she saw him unload the documents he’d found, Lucy stood up and walked over to the table to join Tim. 
“What did you find there?” Lucy said.
“I don’t know, exactly. Most of these are designs for the Terrarium and the Habitat, but some of the others…,” Tim said, “It’s like DNA tests of some kind. I don’t really know, but something about this whole operation just rubs me the wrong way.”
Tim looked up from the documents and walked over to another filing cabinet across the room.
“What are you doing? Don’t you think we should try to get out of here?” Lucy said.
Tim pulled the cabinet open and started rustling through it. 
“I think we’re in some kind of archive room,” he said, “I just… I don’t know. Why would they do this? It’s wrong. I mean sure he’s not homo sapien. But he’s still human. And they’re called human rights, not homo sapien rights.”
“Okay, I get it. What are you looking for? I’ll help you look”
“Nothing in particular. I’m just trying to understand. What are they doing here?”
Lucy pulled out another filing cabinet and rustled through the papers. Occasionally, she would pull one out and scan it then lay it on the table. She kept going through these motions until one of them caught her attention and held it there. She got stuck on it. What she was reading didn’t make sense. Keeping that paper in hand she pulled out the one behind it and read it. Then she pulled the next one out, and the next one, and the next one. Each subsequent paper came out quicker and quicker until the resulting flurry pulled Tim’s attention.
“What’s going on?” He asked.
“Come look at this,” Her voice trembled.
Lucy’s face contorted when she handed him the paper.
Arnold Sargot had a secret. Lucy and Tim were staring right at it in disgust. 
Tim read through the papers and the details began to haunt him. He learned of a man born 20 years earlier in 19__. His height and weight were listed and dated five years later. The top right corner held a picture of a five year old child. A name was printed on all the documents: ___. Lucy handed Tim the next sheet. It had the same information as the previous one, but now the kid was a little taller, a little heavier, and seven years old. His eyes in the new picture had sunken just a little more. Lucy kept handing him more papers. With each new sheet Tim watched the person grow. He saw their weight fluctuate. And he saw the light of their eyes grow dimmer. His cheeks and skin swallowed more with each subsequent year. 
Finally, Lucy finished handing Tim 20 years worth of data sheets. Tim looked at the most recent pictures then looked up at Lucy. Tears streamed down her face and she started wailing.  Tim pulled her in for a hug. He looked over at the neanderthal and couldn’t stop himself from crying with his friend. 
At that moment the backroom door slid open, and a man stepped out wearing a silver suit and a sympathetic smile. 
“Hello Children,” Arnold Sargot said, “You seem to find yourself somewhere you are not supposed to be.”
The kids turned around and stood frozen, caught in their act. Lucy then broke her trance and sprinted for the door. Arnold Sargot watched her with no change in his expression. He slipped his hand out of his pocket and pushed a button on a remote control. The door made an audible clicking noise right before Lucy reached it. She grabbed the handle and pulled on it as hard as she could muster, but the door had locked with a deadbolt and did not budge.
“Not much use in running, I would say,”
Sargot’s English was nearly impeccable, but a sliver of an accent betrayed his heritage. 
“What you’ve been doing here, it’s inhumane. You’re a monster,” Tim said to him doing his best to suppress the quiver in his voice.
“I wouldn’t expect you to understand. You are still young, idealistic,” Sargot replied, “But you are wrong. I am an inspiration. I give people reason to hope for a better future. And I am creating that future for them”
“No you’re worsening the world! You… you kidnapped… a kid!” Lucy screamed at him, “Exp… experimented on him!”
Lucy pointed at the neanderthal, “How can you look at what you’ve done to this man and look at yourself in the mirror?”
“This world needs inspiration and it needs technological advancement. The public needs to know that the future is good and that it is possible to achieve it. The means by which we give them that inspiration doesn’t much matter does it? So long as progress continues,” Sargot continued. “They come here in awe of what I, of what we humans, have accomplished. A simulated, contained reproduction of the Ice Age. Capable of sustaining life. Fauna, flora, and even human.”
“Even human…,” Tim said through a wrinkled nose. “He is human isn’t he? Er.. Homo Sapien, I mean. Not neanderthal. I saw the files. He was taken from his home. From his family.”
Sargot hummed through his soft smile.
“But there were DNA tests…” Lucy said, “They matched the fossil records for the neanderthal… how did you…?”
“Ah yes, what an achievement no?” Sargot answered with a chuckle. “Some of our research labs, one studying E. Coli and another studying yogurt bacteria, discovered the most peculiar phenomenon. These bacteria, over millennia of war with viruses, developed a defense mechanism that allowed them to edit sections of their own genetic code.”
Lucy stared at Sargot with an anger that only boiled hotter with each passing minute.
Sargot continued, “It did not take long for my scientists to realize that this mechanism could be isolated, replicated, expanded, and exploited. You clearly know about our genetic sequencing technology. Well, we secretly also developed a genetic engineering technology that eventually allowed us to edit the human genome. And all we needed to test it, was a malleable subject. A canvas for human progress.”
“You’re sick,” Lucy spat.
“You’re a fraud,” Tim said. “You never achieved time travel.”
“A fraud?” Sargot said. “No. Last year my company came out with a vaccination to combat Malaria, a cure for Multiple Sclerosis, and in three months time we will announce an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s. All of these are real medical achievements. Do you think it matters to anyone the means by which we developed them? They won’t give a fuck about whether time travel actually exists or not. They’ll be too preoccupied by the greater good that we have produced. We’ll silently shut the ‘Time Travel’ program down and give some reason about public safety concerns. They will eat it up.”
“You’re wrong. You won’t get away with this. Once people find out what you’ve done… You’re a monster. They’ll shut you down. You’re going to prison for the rest of your life,” Lucy said.
“I highly doubt it. But then again maybe you’re correct. Best not to take that risk,” 
A sadistic smile slithered across Sargot’s face. Tim saw it and made a desperate attempt to lunge at Sargot. He stuck his hand out, aiming for the remote that Sargot had used to lock them into the room. Sargot barely flinched. He sidestepped when he saw the boy barreling towards him then smacked him to the ground.
“Enough of this,” Sargot said before pressing another button on his remote. A red light turned on above the doorway and a group of armed guards marched out. 
“I’m sorry the two of you got yourselves in so deep. Although, it has been entertaining to watch,”
The guards grabbed the kids by the arms and lifted them up. Lucy screamed and tried to bite her captors, but it had no effect on their thick uniforms. Tim, still dazed from the hit he took, slumped over and let them lift him without resistance.
Sargot watched his private security drag the intruders away through the backdoor of the room. 
He spoke into his ear piece, “Amy I need you to write up a press release detailing a tragic accident involving two local high school seniors who unfortunately wandered into a restricted area of our facility and lost their lives as a result.”
Sargot then walked across the room to where the neanderthal had been cowering during the whole interaction. 
“Come.”
The neanderthal looked up at him and with tears in his eyes followed his captor down the hallway back into the ecological preserve that kept him prisoner.
