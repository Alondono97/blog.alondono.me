Hi! I am Alejandro, a software engineer and writer. Feel free to follow and reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/alondono97).


The spirit of this blog is "thinking in public". I use it to write about topics that are on my mind, and structure my resulting thoughts and worldview. You will likely find more questions here than answers. Though, perhaps, some answers may break through. 

The name is a portmanteau of the word "blog" and my name.
Portmanteau is a French word meaning portmanteau.

I graduated from Texas A&M Universtiy with a B.S. in Computer Science and now work as a software consultant. 

You can see what I am currently reading [here](http://reading.alondono.me).

All content on this site is free and will never have ads, but if you like what I've written and feel obliged to support, you may send Eth to the following:
