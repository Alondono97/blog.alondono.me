# Hey There!

I am Alejandro, a software engineer and writer. Feel free to reach out and follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/alondono97).

The spirit of this blog is "thinking in public". I use it to structure my thoughts on topics I'm interested in. I enjoy writing long form <a href="/blog">essay style posts</a> as well as <a href="/fiction">fictional short stories</a>.

## Education
I graduated from Texas A&M Universtiy with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I now work as a software consultant. 


## Support
All content on this site is free, but if you like what I've written and want to support my writing, I will accept any amount of Eth you would like to send me:
