Hey there! I am Alejandro, a software engineer and writer. Feel free to reach out and follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/alondono97).


The spirit of this blog is "thinking in public". I use it to write about topics that are on my mind, and structure my resulting thoughts and worldview. You will likely find more questions here than answers, though, hopefully, some answers may break through. 


## Education
I graduated from Texas A&M Universtiy with a B.S. in Computer Science and now work as a software consultant. 


## Support
All content on this site is free and will never have ads, but if you like what I've written and feel obliged to support, I will accept any amount of Eth you would like to send me:

The views expressed on this blog are purely my own and do not reflect those of any past, present, or future employer. 

I use Google Analytics to track page views. I am looking to switch to something less invasive, but still free, and am open to recommendations.
