Hi! I am Alejandro, a software engineer and writer.

I use this blog to write about topics that are on my mind and structure my resulting thoughts and worldview.

The name of this blog is a portmanteau of the word "blog" and my name.
Portmanteau is a French word meaning portmanteau.

You can see what I am currently reading [here](http://reading.alondono.me).
