Hi! I am Alejandro, a software engineer and writer.

The spirit of this blog is thinking in public. I use this blog I use this blog to write about topics that are on my mind and structure my resulting thoughts and worldview. You will likely find more questions here than answers. Though, perhaps, some answers may break through. 

The name of this blog is a portmanteau of the word "blog" and my name.
Portmanteau is a French word meaning portmanteau.

I graduated from Texas A&M Universtiy with a B.S. in Computer Science and now work as a software consultant. 

You can see what I am currently reading [here](http://reading.alondono.me).
