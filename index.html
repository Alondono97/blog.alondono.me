        Hi! I am Alejandro, a software engineer and writer. 
        You can learn more about me under the <a href="/about">about</a> page.
        Feel free to reach out and follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/alondono97">twitter</a>.

        The spirit of this blog is "thinking in public". 
        I use it to write about topics that are on my mind.
        Most posts on here are actually more along the lines of <a href="/blog">essays</a> than blogs, and a few are <a href="/fiction">fictional short stories</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Listed below you will find the full collection of both writing categories (essays and fiction) in chronological order.
