        Hi! I am Alejandro, a software engineer and writer. 
        Feel free to reach out and follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/alondono97">twitter</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The spirit of this <a href="/blog">blog</a> is "thinking in public". 
        I use it to write about topics that are on my mind, and 
        structure my resulting thoughts and worldview. 
        You will likely find more questions here than answers, 
        though, hopefully, some answers may break through. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I also write fiction, mainly short stories, which you can find <a href="/fiction">here</a>.

        <br>

        Listed below you will find both categories of writing (blogs and fiction) in chronological order.
